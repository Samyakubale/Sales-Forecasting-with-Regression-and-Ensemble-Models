# Sales-Forecasting-with-Regression-and-Ensemble-Models
This project was developed during my Data Science internship and focuses on predicting retail sales using machine learning techniques. The objective is to forecast Item Outlet Sales based on historical sales data and outlet characteristics.
Problem Statement

Accurate sales forecasting helps retailers optimize inventory management, improve supply chain efficiency, and maximize revenue.
This project aims to predict sales using multiple regression models and identify the best-performing algorithm.
